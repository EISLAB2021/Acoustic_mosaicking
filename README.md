Acoustic Image Mosaicking Using Local Feature Matching

# Prerequisites
  Python 3.x
  Numpy
  OpenCV
  Kornia
  SciPy
  Scikit-learn 
  Matplotlib
  Pytorch-lightning         
# Usage
Utilities are defined in python scripts used as modules.Calculate the homography matrix H using the local feature matching results of adjacent overlapping acoustic images, and use the components of H for subsequent image mosaicking.
